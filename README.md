This is a JavaScript application called FlyIn that allows you to create Country cards and Place cards for each country.

## Installation
Fork and clone this repo. In the terminal, cd into the backend ```cd backend``` and then run ```rails s```. Next, you will need to open another terminal and cd into the frontend ```cd frontend``` and then run ```open index.html```.

## Usage
You can add countries as soon as you visit the page by adding a country name and an image. When you submit the country, it will create a country card on the carousel/swiper. In order to go into a country and view its places, click anywhere in the upper portion of the country card (the country name or the pink box). Once you have chosen a country, you can create a place for that country by clicking 'Add Place'. You will be able to add a name, an image and a description for that place. Once submitted, this will create cards showing those attributes. To go back to view all the countries, click on the FlyIn logo on the far left of the banner (you can do this any where in the application to go back to the country cards).
